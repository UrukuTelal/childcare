            <li> <h3>The Sacred Circle of Belonging</h3></li>

        <h2>Statement of Beliefs:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>On The Sacred:</li>
            <p>I believe the Divine is not a being, but being itself -A living presence that moves through stars, soil, breath, blood and thought. It is not above me. It is with me, in me, and of me. As us all.</p>
            <li>On The Soul:</li>
            <p>Souls do not need saving. They are not broken nor lost -They are whole, remembering, evolving, shapeshifting. We are not born in sin. We are born in forgetfulness. Our journey is not salvation but a return -to essence, balance, and wonder.</p>
            <li>On Earth & Ancestors</li>
            <p>Terra is sacred. It's waters speak. Our ancestors walk with us -Seen and unseen. I honor the First People of every land and the teachings carried in bones, dreams and story.</p>
            <li>On Community & Justice</li>
            <p>I belive in Chosen Family, Sacred Kinship and Mutual Liberation. No one is free unless we all are free. I walk beside the oppressed, the exiled, the different, and the dreaming. Love is not soft -It is protective, unapologetic, and fierce.</p>
            <li>On Practice & Mystery</li>
            <p>I practice silence, play, ritual, and wonder. I do not worship -I connect. I do not convert -I witness. I honor paradox. I trust mystery. I don't need answers, just truth.</p>
            <li>On Identiry & Spirit</li>
            <p>I am sovereign. My gender, spirit, expression and identity are holy in the complexity. I am fluid and rooted. I am two-spirit and many-named. My body -my alter. My mind -my temple.</p>
            <li>On Teachings & Lineage</li>
            <p>I draw wisdom from many paths: Christ, Buddha, Black Elk, Rumi, Laozi, and all who teach from love, liberation, and living truth. I do not follow dogma. I follow the pulse of truth where it lives.</p>
            <li>On Death & Beyond</li>
            <p>I do not fear death. The veil is thin. The sacred is near. Ancestors become us, and we return. There is no punishment, nor reward, just renewal.</p>
