                When I first enrolled in this course, I didn’t realize I wanted to teach. What I knew for sure was that I wanted to work with children—ideally in a daycare setting that I could eventually run. I didn’t associate this with teaching at the time; I thought of it more as watching and playing with children, which is what I genuinely love to do. It was only through this course that I came to understand: even in a daycare environment, I am a teacher. Every interaction, every moment of play, every routine is part of a child’s learning experience.

                In my home, I currently live with and help care for three children—though they are not my own, they’ve become a big part of my life. There’s a teenager who’s almost 16, a five-year-old who is paraverbal, and a very vocal nine-month-old infant. (Well, she’s loud—but wonderfully so!) They are my roommate’s children, and I assist with their care whenever I can.

                My passion for working with children comes from both lived experience and family influence. My mother was a Registered Nurse and Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (RN PNP), and from her I inherited both a deep love for children and a nurturing disposition. Watching her and helping care for children in my home confirmed what I already felt: I was meant to work with young children.

                I’ve found that I naturally embody many of the traits described in our textbook as belonging to <strong>“High Quality Teachers,”</strong> such as being reflective, compassionate, authentic, supportive, encouraging, safe, kind, approachable, and present. I’m especially patient and engaged with children ages eight and under. I genuinely love interacting, playing, and bonding with them.

                In the multiple intelligences self-assessment, I was surprised by my results. My highest score was in <strong>Intrapersonal Intelligence</strong>, followed closely by <strong>Interpersonal</strong>, <strong>Linguistic</strong>, and <strong>Logical-Mathematical</strong> intelligences—all scoring above 3.5. I had expected Linguistic to rank highest, as I’ve always had a strong connection to language. In sixth grade, I already had college-level reading comprehension and earned the nickname <em>“Mr. Dictionary.”</em> I would read ahead in class or finish the assigned book quickly and move on to something else—much to the frustration of my teachers.

                I didn’t expect to score high in Interpersonal Intelligence, since I’m quite introverted and often feel awkward in social situations. However, I’ve learned how to present myself professionally and mask many of my social anxieties, especially when working with children.

                When it came to exploring job titles, I turned to ChatGPT for ideas. I asked for roles that would align with an Early Intervention Associate in Science in Child Development, particularly those involving care for children with autism and ADHD. Of the list provided, the titles that resonated with me most were: <strong>Behavioral Interventionist</strong>, <strong>Early Intervention Specialist</strong>, and <strong>Developmental Therapist</strong>. I plan to pursue my A.S. Degree in Early Intervention and work toward certifications that align with my growing goals in this field.
